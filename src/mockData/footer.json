Justin C. Schilling is an 'Actor’s Actor'. Theatre, film, and television, there isn’t any area of the craft he doesn’t​ ​passionately embrace and joyfully climb the ladder of hard work to achieve. As he has attracted more auditions and professional work, he has always  continued his training, jumping back into Master Class ready to stretch and continue to grow on his artistic path.​ ​Recently, Justin also played a major role in the play Katie, that I directed at Theater for the New City. Through insight, hard work and dedication, he evolved into the character, illuminating the play and earning the respect of the cast, playwright and myself. He never says 'I can’t' or 'No' to the director. Always open to new ideas and directorial impulses, he will turn himself inside out to help the director turn their ideas into reality. He is a true leader on set inspiring all to 'bring their best', with his charm, humility and love of the process. As he keeps raising the bar and owning his work, everyone he works with wants Justin to be a part of their future productions. He is truly an 'Acting Lion'.'
